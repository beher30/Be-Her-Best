# Quick Start: AWS S3 Integration

## 🚀 Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Set Up AWS Credentials
```bash
# Install AWS CLI
pip install awscli

# Configure AWS (you'll need your AWS access keys)
aws configure
```

### Step 2: Create S3 Bucket
```bash
# Run the automated setup script
cd "Website 1.4nh"
python setup_aws_s3.py
```

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables to Render
In your Render dashboard, add these environment variables:
```
USE_S3=True
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
AWS_S3_REGION_NAME=us-east-1
```

### Step 4: Test the Integration
```bash
# Test S3 connection and file uploads
python test_s3_integration.py
```

### Step 5: Deploy
```bash
# Deploy to Render
git add .
git commit -m "Add S3 integration"
git push
```

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Environment Variable**: `USE_S3=True` enables S3 storage
2. **File Uploads**: All file uploads go to S3 instead of local storage
3. **File Access**: Files are served directly from S3 URLs
4. **Fallback**: If S3 is disabled, it falls back to local storage

## 📊 File Organization in S3

```
your-bucket-name/
├── static/                    # Static files (CSS, JS)
├── media/
│   ├── public/               # Public files (profile pictures)
│   │   ├── profile_pictures/
│   │   └── course_thumbnails/
│   └── private/              # Private files (payment proofs)
│       └── payment_proofs/
```

## 🎯 Benefits

✅ **No Local Storage**: Files stored in the cloud  
✅ **Scalable**: Handle unlimited file uploads  
✅ **Reliable**: AWS S3 is highly available  
✅ **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for what you use  
✅ **CDN Ready**: Easy to add CloudFront later  

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **AWS Costs**: S3 has minimal costs (~$0.023/GB/month)
2. **Security**: Private files are protected, public files are accessible
3. **Backup**: S3 automatically replicates your files
4. **Performance**: Files load faster with S3 than local storage
